We believe **everyone is capable of doing much more with computers** â€“ which is why we're giving you a **personal server**.

Using your personal server is easy, because we set up all the hard stuff, designed a friendly interface, and created an AI that lives on your server. But to help you get the most out of your server, we believe in teaching you how to fish.

In this guide, we'll teach you some basics about how servers and the internet work. This will prepare you for the other guides in this section, which will show you how you can use your server to host websites, run services, connect to other computers, and more.

<Tip>Zo is for everyone, so this guide assumes you have no prior experience with computer programming or servers.</Tip>
