We believe **everyone is capable of doing much more with computers** â€“ which is why we're giving you a [**personal server**](/servers).

Using your personal server is easy, because we set up all the hard stuff, designed a friendly interface, and created an AI that lives on your server.

To help you get the most out of your server, we'll try our best to teach you <Icon icon="fish" /> **how to fish**.

<Universe />

<Tip>
  Zo is for everyone, so all our guides assume you have no prior experience with AI, computer programming or servers.
  Our <Icon icon="fish" /> **Learn to fish** content is intended to help you understand the underlying concepts so that
  you can have more productive conversations with Zo.
