On Zo, you can choose between leading AI models for chatting, research, coding, and generating media. We believe in giving you the power to explore different models so that you can get the best results for any task.

Zo Computer currently supports:

- A large selection of **language** models
- A variety of **image generation** models
- A **transcription** model, for converting speech in audio files to text
- An **image-to-video** model, for converting an image into a 5 second video

We rigorously evaluate models to ensure we offer the leading models in each modality (with a preference for providers that are both fast and high-quality). If there's a model you'd like to see, just ask [in Discord](https://discord.gg/2eZZ4NWE7G).

You can change your model from the Zo chat. Our default choice is [Grok Code Fast 1](https://x.ai/news/grok-code-fast-1), a speedy model that excels at coding, but is also great for general tasks.

You can set your default model for chat and other modalities from the Settings page.
