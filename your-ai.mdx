## Choose your model

On Zo, you can choose between all the leading AI models for chatting, research, coding, and generating media. We believe in giving you the power to explore different models so that you can get the best results for any task.

### Transparent pricing

Zo provides direct access to AI models without any artificial constraints or limitations. Unlike other tools that mediate your interaction with these models to fit their subscription economics, we practice fair, transparent AI pricing.

Each Zo subscription plan comes with built-in monthly AI credits. Usage beyond your monthly credit allotment is charged to you at-cost: using the same rates we pay our underlying AI model providers.

## Provide context

We believe in giving you the power to shape your AI's behavior. The primary tool for this is "context".

### Customize behavior

Beyond choosing between different models, we provide a growing number of tools for shaping your AI's behavior. You can:

### Rules to guide behavior

### Zofiles to switch between modes

"Zofiles" are AI profiles that make it easy to switch between working styles or personas.
