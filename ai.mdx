## Choose your model

On Zo, you can choose between all the leading AI models for chatting, research, coding, and generating media. We believe in giving you the power to explore different models so that you can get the best results for any task. (You can read our thoughts on model selection [on our blog](https://zo.computer/blog/model-selection).)

<Info>
  Zo provides direct access to AI models without any artificial constraints or limitations. Unlike other tools that mediate your interaction with these models to fit their subscription economics, we practice fair, transparent AI pricing. Learn more on our [Pricing](/pricing) page.

## Provide context

Giving your AI context from files in your workspace is the most powerful way to shape what your AI does. When you open a file, it automatically gets added to the context of the current chat. You can also mention additional files or tools you want your AI to use, or drag files from the file browser to the chat.

When you open the "Chats" tab with a file open, if you've had previous conversations with that file, you'll see them in the "With this file" tab.

## Customize behavior

In addition to our model selector and tools for giving your AI context from your workspace, we offer several additional ways to customize your AI's behavior.

### Rules to guide behavior

"Rules" are prompts provided to your AI when it responds to you â€“ either every time, or conditionally.

### Zofiles to switch between modes

"Zofiles" are AI profiles that make it easy to switch between working styles or personas.

### Tasks for future or repeating work

"Tasks" are prompts for your AI to follow in the future. You can schedule a one-time task in the future, or a recurring task at any interval.
