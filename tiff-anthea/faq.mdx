**What is Zo?**

- Zo is an AI computer that lives in the cloud that both you and AI can control. More tangibly, Zo offers:
  - cloud workspace - just like Google Drive or Notion
  - a universal chat - that doesn't just talk to you, but can do work for you and connect to your workspace to help you learn, create files, do research, reorganize your work, and publish your work to webpages
  - a personal server - like AWS, where you can run your own programs, applications, and services, which can in turn also be managed by the universal chat

**What would I use Zo for?**

- You can do research, build personal projects, and get your digital work done in your own personalized workspace. For more use cases, please visit [What You Can Do With Zo](https://docs.zocomputer.com/Use-Cases).
