You can connect your Zo to various apps and services from the Settings page.

By default, Zo will get **Read Only** access to the app or service, meaning that it can only view data but not modify it. To give Zo the ability to modify data, select the **Read/Write** option.

<Tip>
Your Zo Computer can be used as a file storage service.

To sync a folder on your computer with your Zo workspace, follow our [Sync files and folders](/syncthing) guide.

injection.
