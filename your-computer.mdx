Your Zo Computer comes with a workspace where you can work with all kinds of files, including documents and spreadsheets, images, video and audio files, and code. Your AI can browse, edit, and organize your files, and also create or download new files.

Some people can do practically anything with a computer, because they know how to "speak computer". Now, you can **just talk to Zo**, and do things with a computer that were previously out of reach. 

Zo can make quick work out of small tasks, like converting files, creating simple websites, or data analysis. For larger projects, all you have to do is have a longer conversation with Zo.

Because your Zo Computer is a **server**, you can use it to host websites or services and talk to other computers on the internet. You can sync files from your computer to your Zo Computer. You can host a media server. You can even set up Zo to control your laptop, or other devices at home.
