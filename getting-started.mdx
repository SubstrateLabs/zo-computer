**Connect your email and phone number: **Email your Zo ([yourusername@zo.computer](mailto:yourusername@zo.computer)) from as many emails as you'd like to get content from your Zo files, save articles, organize your workspace, execute work, and more. Link your phone number so you can talk to Zo even more easily to do all of the above.
