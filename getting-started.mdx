Files are the central way to collaborate with Zo. Try jotting down your thoughts in a note, then ask Zo to research and expand on what you've written.

/>
</Frame>

You can also upload files or folders, and connect apps like Google Drive or Notion to import files.

One simple way to get started with Zo is to save articles from the web and discuss them with Zo. When you're on the go, you can email or text links to Zo. When Zo replies, you can ask follow-up questions, or ask for a quick summary.

/>

  className="hidden dark:block"

/>
</Frame>

When you have a file open, you can ask Zo to explain it, or edit it, or convert it into a different format. Zo can work with nearly any kind of file.

You can talk to PDFs:

<Frame>
<img 
  className="block dark:hidden" 
  src="/screenshots/pdf-light.png" 
/>
<img 
  className="hidden dark:block" 
  src="/screenshots/pdf-dark.png" 
/>
</Frame>

Or work with spreadsheets:

<Frame>
<img 
  className="block dark:hidden" 
  src="/screenshots/sheet-light.png" 
/>
<img 
  className="hidden dark:block" 
  src="/screenshots/sheet-dark.png" 
/>
</Frame>

And much more:
- Zo can do research on the web, and generate documents or presentations.
- Zo can find and download datasets, and write code to analyze and visualize data. You can ask Zo to process your health data, or your iMessages, or your bank statements.
- Zo can generate or edit images using AI, transcribe speech in audio and video files, and run tools for working with digital media. You can ask Zo to create any pipeline you can imagine for creating art, or just processing media files.
