## Rules

You can use Rules to customize how you want your AI to behave.

Rules consist of two parts:

1. A **condition**. This is optional â€“ if you don't provide one, the rule will always be used.
2. A **prompt**. This is the instruction that Zo should follow.

## Zofiles

Zofiles let you create "profiles" for your AI.

You might find them useful:

- If you frequently reuse the same prompt for a particular task
- If you have multiple modes of work that you want to switch between
- If you want to experiment with different AI personalities
