## Chat with Zo from anywhere to learn, research, and work

Zo is 1000% better than other chatbots because

- You can freely switch across any of the leading models
- Zo chat doesn't just talk--it can also do research and execute work tasks too
- Zo's chat can be accessed through the desktop browser and app, email, and text
- You can apply different [rules and personas (ie Zofiles)](https://docs.zocomputer.com/getting-started#your-ai) to your chat to get tailored responses

## Create any file

Create folders and all types of files (notes,pages, spreadsheets). Learn how to import your files from Google Drive and Notion in [Getting Started](https://docs.zocomputer.com/getting-started#integrations). You can create files by asking Zo via chat or manually selecting the blue"Create" button in the top left of your screen.

## Do work on your files with Zo chat

Once you have your files uploaded, you can directly chat with Zo to:

- Do research on your files (ie _Look through all of my files in "Medical" folder and give me a summary of my health and recommended exercise habits"_)
- Reorganize your files based on content (ie _Find all my files that say "dog" and put them in a new folder named "Dog"_)
- Generate new documents based on your files (ie _Create an "Executive Summary" file based on my "Q4 Earnings" folder)_

## Chat with Zo via text or email

If you're on the go, you can do simple work tasks with Zo via text or email. Example prompts below:

- Talk to Zo (ie _Why did the Roman Empire die?_)
- Save article as files (ie _Add this BBC article to my "Articles" folder)_
- Add lines to spreadsheets (ie _Add \$5 coffee to my "Expenses" file_)
- Edit files (ie _Make my "Wednesday journal" file more concise at 300 words max)_
- Summarize files (ie _Summarize the major points in "Lecture 201" file_)

To learn how to connect your email and phone number, please visit [Getting Started.](https://docs.zocomputer.com/getting-started#integrations)

Keep in mind some more complicated tasks such as summarizing foldersor doing image editing are still best over the Zo desktop browser or Zo desktop app.

## Publish sites based on any of your files

(work in progress)

## Create one-time or reccurring scheduled tasks

Create scheduled tasks to

- Automate work tasks
- Set reminders for yourself
- Track your activity or mental state
- Create moments of inspiration, and more

Unlike a normal chatbot, Zo will remember these requests consistently over time.
