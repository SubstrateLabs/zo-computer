## Do work on your files

Once you have your files uploaded, you can directly chat with Zo to:

- Do research on your files (ie _Look through all of my files in "Medical" folder and give me a summary of my health and recommended exercise habits"_)
- Analyze data  (ie _Look through all of my files in "Medical" folder and give me a summary of my health and recommended exercise habits"_)
- Reorganize your files based on content (ie _Find all my files that say "dog" and put them in a new folder named "Dog"_)

## Do work or chat to Zo via text or email

If you're on the go, you can do simple work tasks with Zo via text or email. Example prompts below:

- Talk to Zo (ie _Why did the Roman Empire die?_)
- Save article as files (ie _Add this BBC article to my "Articles" folder)_
- Add lines to spreadsheets (ie _Add \$5 coffee to my "Expenses" file_)
- Edit files (ie _Make my "Wednesday journal" file more concise at 300 words max)_
- Summarize files (ie _Summarize the major points in "Lecture 201" file_)

Keep in mind some more complicated tasks such as summarizing foldersor doing image editing are still best over the Zo desktop browser or Zo desktop app.
