Your Zo comes with a built-in way to create sites hosted on your Zo server. Select <Icon icon="zap" /> **Create site**, and Zo will create a new website template for you in a new folder with the lightning icon <Icon icon="zap" />. When you select the site's folder, you'll see a preview of the site.

Because your site is hosted on your **personal server** along with your other files, you can easily incorporate files from your workspace into your site. This means you can do things like:

- Save responses from a form to a database in your workspace.
- Integrate any file or folder from your workspace into your site.

All you have to do is mention the files or folders you want to incorporate as you chat with Zo.

## Accessing your site

You'll get a URL to access your site that looks like this: `sitename-yourhandle.zocomputer.io`

<Info>

> this is a special service, needs auth, you can publish it with a user service

You don't have to know how to code to create websites, because Zo can write the code for you. But knowing a bit about what's going on behind the scenes can help you have more productive conversations with Zo.

Zo creates a simple but powerful website template using [Hono](https://hono.dev), a popular web application framework.

<Info>
  The built-in site tool is our recommended way to create websites on your Zo. But of course, you can use
  [services](/servers) to run anything on your Zo, using any technology you want.
</Info>

Websites have two sides, the **backend** and the **frontend**.

- The **backend** is the part of your site that runs on your server.
- The **frontend** is the part of your site that runs in the browser.
  - Your backend delivers your site's frontend code to the user's browser, and the browser runs your frontend.

<Accordion title="What are the code files inside my site?">

- <Icon icon="file-code" /> `.gitignore` – Used to ignore files that should not be tracked in version history.
- <Icon icon="file-code" /> `bun.lock` – Used to "lock" the versions of software packages used in your site.
- <Icon icon="file-text" /> `CLAUDE` – Documentation used by the Zo coding agent when it works on your site. You can
  edit this file to provide additional guidance to the coding agent.
- <Icon icon="file-code" /> `index.tsx` – The main code file for your site. For simple sites, Zo will write all the code
  in this file. As your site grows, Zo may create additional code files.
- <Icon icon="file-json" /> `tsconfig.json` – Your site uses the TypeScript programming language, and this file
  configures your site's TypeScript settings.
- <Icon icon="file-json" /> `zosite.json` – Settings for how your site is hosted on your Zo server.

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="What else should I know about my site?">

- [Hono](https://hono.dev) is the **web server**. When we call Hono a "server", we really mean that it's the [service](/servers#what-is-a-service%3F): a program that handles requests to your site.
- [Bun](https://bun.sh) is the **runtime**, which runs the web server.
- Bun is also the **package manager**. As you add more functionality to your site's backend server, Zo may use Bun to install additional software packages.
