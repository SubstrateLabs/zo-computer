Your Zo subscription comes with an always-on cloud computer and monthly AI credits. Usage beyond your monthly AI credit allotment is charged to you at-cost, using the same rates we pay our underlying AI model providers.

You can view our plans at [zo.computer/pricing](https://zo.computer/pricing).

<Info>
  You can manage your subscription and view your upcoming invoice inside your Zo on the Billing page, accessible from the top of the Settings page.
</Info>

We provide you with direct access to AI models without any artificial constraints or limitations. Unlike other tools that mediate your interaction with these models to fit their subscription economics, we practice fair, transparent AI pricing.

If you're excited about sharing Zo with your community, fill outÂ [this application](https://forms.gle/FdwkQYmyxDGvBwu98). If you're accepted, we'll grant you a discounted plan, bonus AI credits that never expire, and give you promo codes to share.

If you have any questions about billing or feedback, please get in touch: you can chat with the Zo team in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/2eZZ4NWE7G), or contact [support@zocomputer.com](mailto:support@zocomputer.com).
