Your Zo subscription comes with an always-on cloud computer and monthly AI credits. Usage beyond your monthly AI credit allotment is charged to you at-cost, using the same rates we pay our underlying AI model providers.

You can view our plans at [zo.computer/pricing](https://zo.computer/pricing).

<Info>
  You can manage your subscription and view your upcoming invoice inside your Zo on the Billing page, accessible from the top of the Settings page.
