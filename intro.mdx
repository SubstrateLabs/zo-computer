Zo Computer is an AI computer. We give your AI full access to a dedicated computer in the cloud, where it can:

- Access the internet and download files and programs
- Write code, run programs, and host web services
- Control other devices you connect to your Zo Computer

Both you and your AI can use this computer to do research, build personal projects, and get your digital work done in a unified workspace.

You can access Zo in the browser at **<HandleLink />**, and with our [macOS app](https://github.com/SubstrateLabs/Zo/releases/latest/download/Zo.dmg).

You can also talk to your Zo over email at **<Handle />@zo.computer**, and over text (US only).

To learn how other people use Zo, come chat with the Zo team and other Zo Computer users on [Discord](https://discord.gg/2eZZ4NWE7G).
