Zo Computer is an AI computer. We give your AI full access to a dedicated computer in the cloud, where it can:

- Access the internet and download files and programs
- Write code, run programs, and host web services
- Control other devices you connect to your Zo Computer

Both you and your AI can use this computer to do research, build personal projects, and get your digital work done in a unified workspace.

You can access Zo in the browser at **<HandleLink />**, and with our [macOS app](https://github.com/SubstrateLabs/Zo/releases/latest/download/Zo.dmg).

You can also talk to your Zo over email at **<Handle />@zo.computer**, and over text (US only).

To learn how other people use Zo, come chat with the Zo team and other Zo Computer users on [Discord](https://discord.gg/2eZZ4NWE7G).

## Your workspace

Your Zo Computer comes with a workspace where you can work with all kinds of files, including documents and spreadsheets, images, video and audio files, and code. Your AI can browse, edit, and organize your files, and also create or download new files.

Giving your AI context from files in your workspace is the most powerful way to shape what your AI does. When you open a file, it automatically gets added to the context of the current chat. You can also mention additional files or tools you want your AI to use, or drag files from the file browser to the chat.

Practically anything is possible on a computer. And we've given Zo a particularly powerful kind of computer (a [server](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_(computing)>)). Zo can make quick work out of small tasks, like converting files, creating simple websites, or data analysis. For larger projects, all you have to do is have a longer conversation with Zo.

## Things you can do

Files are the central way to collaborate with Zo. Try jotting down your thoughts in a note, then ask Zo to research and expand on what you've written. You can also upload files or folders, and connect apps like Google Drive or Notion to import files.

One simple way to get started with Zo is to save articles from the web and discuss them with Zo. When you're on the go, you can email or text links to Zo. When Zo replies, you can ask follow-up questions, or ask for a quick summary.

When you have a file open, you can ask Zo to explain it, or edit it, or convert it into a different format. Zo can work with nearly any kind of file.

You can talk to PDFs:

Or work with spreadsheets:

</Frame>

And much more:

- Zo can do research on the web, and generate documents or presentations.
- Zo can find and download datasets, and write code to analyze and visualize data.
  - You can ask Zo to write code to analyze your fitness data, or search your text messages, or test a hypothetical trading strategy.
- Zo can generate or edit images using AI, transcribe speech in audio and video files, and run tools for working with digital media.
  - You can ask Zo to analyze a folder full of voice recordings, or crop and convert a thousand photos, or generate diagrams and animations.
