Zo Computer is an AI computer. We give your AI full access to a dedicated [computer in the cloud](/servers). Both you and your AI can use this computer to do research, build personal projects, and get your digital work done in a unified workspace.

<Tip>
  To learn how other people use Zo, come chat with the Zo team and other Zo users in
  [Discord](https://discord.gg/2eZZ4NWE7G).
</Tip>

Your Zo Computer comes with a workspace where you and your AI can work with all kinds of files. Your AI can browse, edit, and organize your files, and also create or download new files.

When you open a file, it automatically gets added to the AI chat. You can also mention additional files, or drag files from the file browser to the chat.
