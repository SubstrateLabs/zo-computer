Zo Computer is an AI computer. We give your AI full access to a dedicated [computer in the cloud](/servers). Both you and your AI can use this computer to do research, build personal projects, and get your digital work done in a unified workspace.

<Tip>
  To learn how other people use Zo, come chat with the Zo team and other Zo users in
  [Discord](https://discord.gg/zocomputer).
</Tip>

The Zo application can be used:

- <Icon icon="globe" /> In your browser at <HandleLink />
- <Icon icon="app-window" /> In our [macOS app](https://github.com/SubstrateLabs/Zo/releases/latest/download/Zo.dmg)

<Info>
  We plan to release desktop apps for additional platforms soon, and have a mobile app in the works. Zo can be used in
  mobile web browsers.
</Info>

Your Zo also comes with its own email address, **<Handle/>@zo.computer**, and a phone number that you can text.

You can talk to your Zo:

1. <Icon icon="app-window" /> In the Zo application
2. <Icon icon="send" /> By emailing your Zo's email
3. <Icon icon="message-square-more" /> By texting your Zo's number
4. <Icon icon="calendar" /> Using [scheduled tasks](/scheduled-tasks)

You can also ask Zo to <Icon icon="inbox" /> **email you**, or <Icon icon="phone" /> **text you**. For example, if you want to remember something you looked up on Zo when you head out, you can ask Zo to text you the information.

<Tip>
  Texting or emailing Zo is the same as chatting with Zo in the application. You can ask Zo to do things on your
  computer, the same way you would in the Zo chat.
