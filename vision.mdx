Our vision for the future of personal computing is an **intelligent [personal server](/servers)**.

1. **The new soul of your computer is your files, on your server**. You should be able to access this new computer-soul from anywhere, upgrade your hardware on-demand, time travel to a past version of your data at any time, and connect to other machines you own.
2. **Your files and creations should be less fragmented, and more tangibly yours**. On Zo, all files are stored using open file formats. Whenever possible, services are hosted on your server. This includes the Zo application itself, as well as all software created or installed by you or Zo. Your entire Zo Computer can be packaged up, saved, and restored on any machine.
3. **You should have more custody over your AI**. On Zo, you can use any AI model from any provider. All AI memories, search indexes, and settings are stored on your server using open-weight embedding models and open-source software. Our long-term vision is to enable anyone to run, train, and build their own AI models and tools on their own server.
