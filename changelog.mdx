## September 12

When you're texting Zo, you can include images, or voice messages.

> We're still improving Zo's ability to handle text conversations and various attachment formats naturally.

We published a [guide on how to sync files](https://docs.zocomputer.com/syncthing) between another computer and your Zo Computer.

> It takes a bit of set up (5-10 minutes), but it's worth it.

Zo now has the ability to text you: from a conversation, or from a scheduled task.

> If you're chatting with Zo and want to send something to your phone, just ask Zo to text you.

We've made improvements to Zo's ability to search the web.

> - Zo has a new "Research agent" tool, which it can use to conduct extensive research on the web and produce a report or structured data tables. It usually takes 30-60 seconds to complete.
> - Zo has a new "Web research" tool, which we're experimenting with as a more powerful default tool for searching the web.
> - You may see Zo using a mix of "Web search" and "Web research" for most queries, and using the "Research agent" for complex queries.

We've improved Zo's ability edit files and perform complex coding tasks.

> - Zo has a new "Coding agent" tool, which it can use for more complex coding tasks.
> - Zo can now edit files faster.

When you schedule tasks for Zo, you can now configure how you're notified.

> - After a task completes, you can receive a notification with Zo's response via email, SMS, or none.
> - If you schedule a task and set the notification to None, you can prompt Zo to decide whether it should text you an update.

We now hide folders prefixed with periods by default.

> You can show them by going to Settings > Developer > "Show dot folders"

You can now split the Terminal panel into two panes.

> In Settings > Developer, you can also enable "Terminal mode chat", which lets you toggle your chat panel into a Terminal. You can use this to run Claude Code (or your AI CLI of choice) next to your files, instead of the Zo chat.
