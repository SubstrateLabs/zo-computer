## September 12

- When you're texting Zo, you can include images, or voice messages.
  - We're still improving Zo's ability to handle text conversations and various attachment formats naturally.
- We published a <u>guide on how to sync files</u> between another computer and your Zo Computer.
  - It takes a bit of set up (5-10 minutes), but it's worth it.
- Zo now has the ability to text you: from a conversation, or from a scheduled task.
  - If you're chatting with Zo and want to send something to your phone, just ask Zo to text you.
- When you're chatting with Zo about a PDF, Zo can now see and reference the exact page number you're looking at.
- When you generate images with Zo, you can now choose between 3 orientations: square, portrait, or landscape.
- When you schedule tasks for Zo, you can now configure how you're notified.
  - After a task completes, you can receive a notification with Zo's response via email, SMS, or none if you don't want to hear about it.
  - If you schedule a task and set the notification to None, you can prompt Zo to decide whether it should text you an update.
- We've improved Zo's ability to search the web.
  - Zo has a new "Research agent" tool, which it can use to conduct extensive research on the web and produce a report or structured data tables. It usually takes 30-60 seconds to complete.
  - Zo has a new "Web research" tool, which we're experimenting with as a more powerful default tool for searching the web.
  - You may see Zo using a mix of "Web search" and "Web research" for most queries, and using the "Research agent" for complex queries.
- We've improved Zo's ability edit files and perform complex coding tasks.
  - Zo has a new "Coding agent" tool, which it can use for more complex coding tasks.
  - Zo can now edit files faster.
- We added a viewer for SQLite files, so you can explore the tables in your database files.
  - It's easy to create a site that reads or writes data to a SQLite file (or any kind of file) on your Zo Computer.
- We now hide folders prefixed with periods by default.
  - You can show them by going to Settings \> Developer \> "Show dot folders"
- You can now split the Terminal panel into two panes.
  - In Settings \> Developer, you can also enable "Terminal mode chat", which lets you toggle your chat panel into a Terminal. You can use this to run Claude Code (or your AI CLI of choice) next to your files, instead of the Zo chat.
