Your Zo Computer comes with a workspace where you can work with all kinds of files, including documents and spreadsheets, images, video and audio files, and code. Your AI can browse, edit, and organize your files, and also create or download new files.

## Your AI, in a computer

Practically anything is possible on a computer. And we've given Zo a particularly powerful kind of computer (a [server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_(computing))). Zo can make quick work out of small tasks, like converting files, creating simple websites, or data analysis. For larger projects, all you have to do is have a longer conversation with Zo.

Because your Zo Computer is a **server**, you can use it to do things that other apps can't do. You can:
- Publish a website or run a web service, using Zo's built-in hosting tools.
- Sync files from your laptop or other computers to your Zo Computer, using tools like [Syncthing](https://syncthing.net). 
- Talk to Zo to control your laptop or other devices at home, using tools like [SSH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell).
