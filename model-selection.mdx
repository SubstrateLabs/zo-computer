On Zo, you can choose between leading AI models for chatting, research, coding, and generating media. We believe in giving you the power to explore different models so that you can get the best results for any task.

We rigorously evaluate models to ensure we offer the leading models in each modality. We'll continue expanding our model selection for chat, image generation, and new modalities like video and audio.

You can choose your language model in the chat:

<Frame caption="Using the model selector in the chat">
  <img className="block dark:hidden" src="/screenshots/models-light.png" />
  <img className="hidden dark:block" src="/screenshots/models-dark.png" />
</Frame>

And you can set your default model for chat and other modalities in Settings:

<Frame caption="Selecting models in settings">
  <img className="block dark:hidden" src="/screenshots/settings-model-light.png" />
  <img className="hidden dark:block" src="/screenshots/settings-model-dark.png" />
</Frame>

<Info>
  Your selected chat model will be used for [scheduled tasks](/scheduled-tasks) and any [interactions with
  Zo](/interactions) outside the chat.

The best way to learn how to use AI effectively is to experiment and explore what works best.

**Prompts** are how you tell your AI what to do. Clear, detailed prompts will improve the quality of your results. Great prompting is all about:

1. Communicating your desired result as clearly as possible. Providing examples or defining what it means for the task to be "done" are both great techniques.
2. Providing context. Remember, you can @-mention files from your workspace, @-mention specific tools you want Zo to use, or share relevant URLs from the internet.
3. Splitting large tasks into a "plan" composed of smaller components.

<Tip>
If you want Zo to do a large task, try asking Zo to **come up with a plan** first.

We recommend asking Zo to write the plan to a note â€“ this will make it easier for you to review and edit the plan (yourself, or with Zo's help), before asking Zo to **execute the plan**.

You can learn more about how the Zo team uses AI to build Zo in our blog post: https://www.zo.computer/blog/model-selection

We'll keep extending this blog post as we learn more and improve our techniques. We've accumulated many hard-earned learnings and best practices from working with AI over the last few years, and we've baked many of our principles into the Zo AI system itself. And of course, we often use Zo to build parts of Zo.
