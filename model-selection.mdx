On Zo, you can choose between leading AI models for chatting, research, coding, and generating media. We believe in giving you the power to explore different models so that you can get the best results for any task.

We rigorously evaluate models to ensure we offer the leading models in each modality. We'll continue expanding our model selection for chat, image generation, and new modalities like video and audio.

You can choose your language model in the chat:

<Frame caption="Using the model selector in the chat">
  <img className="block dark:hidden" src="/screenshots/models-light.png" />
  <img className="hidden dark:block" src="/screenshots/models-dark.png" />
</Frame>

And you can set your default model for chat and other modalities in Settings:

<Frame caption="Selecting models in settings">
  <img className="block dark:hidden" src="/screenshots/settings-model-light.png" />
  <img className="hidden dark:block" src="/screenshots/settings-model-dark.png" />
</Frame>

<Info>
  Your selected chat model will be used for [scheduled tasks](/scheduled-tasks) and any [interactions with
  Zo](/interactions) outside the chat.
