Zo Computer is an AI computer. We give your AI full access to a dedicated computer in the cloud, where it can:

- Access the internet and download files and programs
- Write code, run programs, and host web services
- Control other devices you connect to your Zo Computer

Both you and your AI can use this computer to do research, build personal projects, and get your digital work done in a unified workspace.

You can access Zo in the browser at **yourhandle.zo.computer**, and in our [macOS app](https://github.com/SubstrateLabs/Zo/releases/latest/download/Zo.dmg).

You can also talk to your Zo over email at **yourhandle@zo.computer**, and over text (US only).

## Your AI

On Zo, you can switch between leading AI models for chatting, generating images, transcribing audio, and more. We believe in giving you the power to explore different models so that you can get the best results for any task. 

You can customize your AI even futher by:
- Creating **Rules** to guide behavior
- Creating **Zofiles**: AI profiles that make it easy to switch between different working styles or personas
- Creating **Scheduled Tasks** for your AI to run

## Your Computer

Your Zo Computer comes with a workspace where you can work with all kinds of files, including documents and spreadsheets, images, video and audio files, and code. Your AI can browse, edit, and organize your files, and also create or download new files.

Skilled programmers can do practically anything with a computer, because they know how to "speak computer". Now, you can **just talk to Zo**, and do things with a computer that previously required a lot of technical knowledge. 

Zo can make quick work out of small tasks, like converting files, creating simple websites, or data analysis. For larger projects, all you have to do is have a longer conversation with Zo.

Because your Zo Computer is a **server**, you can use it to host websites or services and talk to other computers on the internet. You can sync files from your computer to your Zo Computer. You can host a media server. You can even set up Zo to control your computer, or other devices at home.
