<Tip>
  Syncing files requires some manual set up. But going through this process is useful, as you will learn how to run other hosted applications and services on your Zo Computer.
</Tip>

# 1. Install SyncThing on your computer

Install SyncThing on your computer by downloading the app from the [SyncThing Downloads](https://syncthing.net/downloads/) page. You may need to use the menu to open the full SyncThing application.

<Frame caption="Click Open from the SyncThing menu to open the application">

Keep this window open – we'll return to it later.

# 2. Install SyncThing on your Zo Computer

To install SyncThing on your Zo Computer, tell Zo to follow the instructions on the [SyncThing Linux installation](https://apt.syncthing.net/) page. Copy and paste the text below into a new chat:

```txt
Run the following commands sequentially to install SyncThing:
mkdir -p /etc/apt/keyrings
curl -L -o /etc/apt/keyrings/syncthing-archive-keyring.gpg https://syncthing.net/release-key.gpg
echo "deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/syncthing-archive-keyring.gpg] https://apt.syncthing.net/ syncthing stable-v2" | tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/syncthing.list
apt-get update
apt-get install syncthing
```

# 3. Run SyncThing on your Zo Computer

Open the Zo System page from the left sidebar:

    src="/screenshots/system-light.png"
  />

  <img
    className="hidden dark:block"
    src="/screenshots/system-dark.png"
  />
</Frame>

Click **"Add service"** to create a new service and fill in the details below:

|                       |                                                      |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Label                 | `syncthing`                                          |
| Local port            | `28384`                                              |
| Type                  | `http`                                               |
| Entrypoint            | `syncthing --no-browser --gui-address=0.0.0.0:28384` |
| Working directory     | `/home/workspace`                                    |
| Environment variables | None                                                 |

<Frame caption="A running SyncThing service">

  />

    src="/screenshots/syncthing-service-dark.png"
  />
</Frame>

Once your service is running, open the SyncThing application using the **Direct Tunnel URL**.

<Info>
  Complex hosted applications may not work via the HTTP Proxy URL. For SyncThing, always use the Direct Tunnel URL.
</Info>

# 4. Password protect your Zo Computer's SyncThing

<Warning>
  You **must set a password** for your Zo Computer's SyncThing. If you don't, anyone with the service URL can access it.

  SyncThing running on your desktop or laptop computer is not publicly accessible, and does not need to be password protected.
</Warning>

# 5. Connect your SyncThings

Open both SyncThing applications. Add your computer as a connected device to your Zo Computer's SyncThing:

1. In your **Zo Computer's SyncThing**, click "Add Remote Device".
2. In **your computer's SyncThing**, click "Actions" → "Show ID" to see your device ID. Copy into the "Add Device" dialog and save.

# 6. Create a shared folder

In your **Zo Computer's SyncThing**, click **"Add Folder"**.

<Info>
  The files you see in the Zo application are in your **workspace**, which is located at `/home/workspace`.

  Your shared **Folder path** must be in your workspace.
</Info>

For example, you might choose:

```sh
/home/workspace/Laptop
```

<Frame caption="Creating a shared folder in your Zo Computer's SyncThing">
  <img
    className="block"
    src="/screenshots/syncthing-folder.png"
  />
</Frame>

In **your computer's SyncThing**, a "New Folder" notification will appear. Click "Add".

In the dialog, choose a location for the folder you want to sync with your Zo Computer. For example, on macOS you might choose:

```sh
~/Documents/Zo Computer
```

<Frame caption="Creating a shared folder in your Zo Computer's SyncThing">

    className="block"
    src="/screenshots/syncthing-folder-confirm.png"
  />
</Frame>

Your SyncThings should now look like this:

<Frame caption="Our two computers are connected">
  <img
    className="block"
    src="/screenshots/syncthing-connected.png"
  />
</Frame>

That's it\! Changes to the shared folder will be synced between your computer and your Zo Computer.

    src="/screenshots/syncthing-synced-light.png"
  />

  <img
    className="hidden dark:block"
    src="/screenshots/syncthing-synced-dark.png"
  />
</Frame>

<Warning>
  The `.stfolder` folder inside your shared folder is used internally by SyncThing. Do not delete it.
