import { Handle, HandleLink } from "/snippets/handle.jsx";

The Zo application can be used:

- In the browser at **<HandleLink />**
- In our [macOS app](https://github.com/SubstrateLabs/Zo/releases/latest/download/Zo.dmg)

You can talk to your Zo:

- In the Zo application.
- By emailing **<Handle />@zo.computer**, using your account's email address, or additional email addresses you register in Settings.
- By texting your Zo's number, using your phone number registered in Settings.
- Using [scheduled tasks](/scheduled-tasks).

You can also ask Zo to:

- Email you from **<Handle />@zo.computer**.
- Text you from your Zo's number.

<Info>
  Texting or emailing Zo is the same as chatting with Zo in the application. You can ask Zo to do things on your
  computer, the same way you would in the Zo chat.
</Info>

## Email with Zo

You can email your Zo at **<Handle />@zo.computer** from any email address you register in Settings.

<Warning>
  Any email you register in your settings can command your Zo and access your Zo computer. Only add email addresses that
  you own or trust.
</Warning>

By default, Zo will only be able to receive emails from you and reply to you, but will not be able to read your emails, or send emails from your email address.

### Connect Gmail for additional capabilities

If you want to give Zo more access to email, you can connect your Gmail account, which will allow Zo to read your emails, and (if you enable Read & write access) send emails using your email address.
