import { Handle, HandleLink } from "/snippets/handle.jsx";

The Zo application can be used:

- <Icon icon="globe" /> In your browser at <HandleLink />
- <Icon icon="app-window" /> In our [macOS app](https://github.com/SubstrateLabs/Zo/releases/latest/download/Zo.dmg)

<Info>
  We plan to release desktop apps for additional platforms soon, and have a mobile app in the works. Zo can be used in
  mobile web browsers.
</Info>

You can talk to your Zo:

1. <Icon icon="app-window" /> In the Zo application
2. <Icon icon="send" /> By emailing <Handle />
   @zo.computer
3. <Icon icon="message-square-more" /> By texting your Zo's number
4. <Icon icon="calendar" /> Using [scheduled tasks](/scheduled-tasks)

You can also ask Zo to <Icon icon="inbox" /> **email you**, or <Icon icon="phone" /> **text you**. For example, if you want to remember something you looked up on Zo when you head out, you can ask Zo to text you the information.

<Tip>
  Texting or emailing Zo is the same as chatting with Zo in the application. You can ask Zo to do things on your
  computer, the same way you would in the Zo chat.
</Tip>

If you want to give Zo more access to email, you can connect your Gmail account, which will allow Zo to read your emails, and (if you enable Read & write access) send emails using your email address.
