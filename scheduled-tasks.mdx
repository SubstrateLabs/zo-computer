Because your AI lives on an always-on computer, it's easy to schedule tasks to run at specific times or intervals.

<Info>
  Scheduled tasks are similar to chatting with Zo in the application. You can ask Zo to do things on your computer, the
  same way you would in the Zo chat.

You can do things like:

- Get a reminder for a habit you're trying to develop
- Summarize your daily work at the end of the day
- Pull content from a website you're following and summarize it
- Run a script to pull data into a database on your computer
